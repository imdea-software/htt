# Hoare Type Theory

This repository contains the main libraries of Hoare Type Theory (HTT)
for reasoning about sequential heap-manipulating programs.

HTT is a verification system which incorporates Hoare style specifications via preconditions and
postconditions, into types. A Hoare type `{P}x : A{Q}` denotes computations with a precondition `P`
and postcondition `Q`, returning a value of type `A`. Hoare types are a dependently typed version
of monads, as used in the programming language Haskell. Monads higenically combine the language
features for pure functional programming, with those for imperative programming, such as state or
exceptions. In this sense, HTT establishes a formal connection between Hoare logic and monads, in
the style of Curry-Howard isomorphism: every effectful command in HTT has a type which corresponds
to the appropriate inference rule in Hoare logic, and vice versa, every inference rule in (a version
of) Hoare logic, corresponds to a command in HTT which has that rule as the type.

## Building and executing artifacts

### Requirements

* [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/download) (>= "8.9.0" & < "8.12~")
* [Mathematical Components](http://math-comp.github.io/math-comp/) `ssreflect` (>= "1.10.0" & < "1.11~")
* [FCSL-PCM](https://github.com/imdea-software/fcsl-pcm) (>= "1.0.0" & < "1.3~")

For the installation, follow instructions in the corresponding
`README` files.

Alternatively, Coq and mathcomp can be installed via the [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)
package manager, by executing the following commands in the console:

```
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-mathcomp-ssreflect coq-fcsl-pcm
```

### Build

```
make clean; make
```

### Install

```
make install
```

### Usage with opam

To install HTT as a opam package from your local repository, run the [following command](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-install-dir/) from the repository's root directory.

```
opam install .
```

  This paper introduces what is closest to the current structure of the implementation of HTT. It puts emphasis on structuring programs and proofs together, rather than on attacking the verification problem using proof automation. It carries out a large case study, verifying the congruence closure algorithm of the Barcelogic SAT solver.

  The current implementation differs from what's explained in this paper, in that it uses unary, rather than binary postconditions.
